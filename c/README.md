# Tennis Kata C translation

The tests here use CMocka. There are makefile targets for running them. If you add more test cases in "TennisTest.c" you need to remember to add them to the list in the main function.

## Internationalization
The Internationalization module contains strings so you can translate scores into different languages. When you have refactored the code to increase readabilty, you can use this module to add functionality to support other languages.

There is a skeleton test case in TennisTest called "checkSwedishGame" that you can implement to check this functionality works.
